I used a Bamblu labs P1S for my prints. I printed the housing on its back and required supports for the saids as well as the bottom of the display side. With out the supports the side tended to lean while being printed.

The template file is to be used to drill mounting holes if necessary.

The PCB for the second ESP32 the S3 and the MAX7765 among other things was fabricated on a perf board. The PCB mounting model is for attaching the two boards together. The perf board I used was [this one](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07Y3DVM1W?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_fed_asin_title&th=1).

I added some electrical tape on the under side of the retainer clips to act as padding. Not totally necessary but it seemed like a good idea to me.
